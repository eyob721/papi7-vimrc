If you ant to add indentation without stopping, then you have to try the “.” Key
from the keyword after using “shift+.”. It will add the indentation from the
starting point until it stops it.


Another method to add the indentation or tab multiple lines at a time is using 
the command line mode of Vim. Within the insert mode, place the cursor at any 
line you want to tab lines, i.e., the 2nd line as shown. You need to open the
visual block mode first for indentation, using the “ctrl+v” shortcut. After that
, press the “next” button to select the number of characters to be indented and 
press “j” to cover the lines to tab along, i.e., 2 to 4.
